Hi, everyone 👋

It's Alex, the creator of 📦 [Cratebox.io](https://cratebox.io) and 📷 [Quick QR](https://www.quick-qr.app) and a few more open-source projects 🧑‍💻 and also the author of "[The JavaScript Cooking Book](https://www.amazon.com/Alex-Casillas/dp/B0BW2GGHHT)" 📗 which some of you have already purchased in digital and printed (a million thanks ❤️)

I'm writing this post/email because, for a long time, I've maintained open-source on my own, everything that I do is bootstrapped and self-funded, but as the open-source projects grow, so the expenses do.

First, let me share with you a list of my best open-source projects:

---

These are just a few, I have a few more but they're not that popular and have not gained much traction, and some other are just utilities that I've created for myself.

After this brief introduction of my open-source projects and products, I'd like you to know that maintaining these projects' infrastructures (for [Cratebox.io](https://cratebox.io) and [Quick QR](https://www.quick-qr.app) especially) is not free, I rely on service providers to keep the websites up and running, the APIs responsive almost 99.9% of the time and the responses time as low as possible and maintaining the applications and improving and fixing possible issues and bugs 🐛 that may appear.

With this in mind, I have created two support projects on Gumroad for you to help me maintain the infrastructure and keep improving the services and features that I offer for free for you to use at any time, these two projects are:

- [Cratebox.io](https://cratebox.io) Support page 👉 [alexcasillas.gumroad.com/l/cratebox-support](https://alexcasillas.gumroad.com/l/cratebox-support)

  On the support page, you can choose any subscription starting from 2€/month to support this specific project ❤️

  On the support page, you can choose any subscription starting from 2€/month to support this specific project ❤️
  You will be shown on the [Quick QR](https://www.quick-qr.app) supporters page and you will have my gratitude 🙇
  These two subscriptions will help me continue delivering open-source libraries, projects, and utilities to every one of you and help me spread them all over the internet and the world to help other people with their needs 🌍

Thank you for reading, and I wish you the best in life

Regards,
Alex ❤️
