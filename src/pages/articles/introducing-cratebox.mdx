For the past couple of days, I've been working on a side project and now it's ready to be shared with you all 🥁 https://cratebox.io - Cratebox.io - A global, fast content delivery network for NPM

Cratebox is a rapid and widespread content delivery network that caters to all of NPM's offerings. It enables you to promptly and effortlessly retrieve any file from any package by employing a URL.

If you are working on something and there's a dependency that you would like to give a try, and don't want to bother installing into your project, you can use the help https://cratebox.io to serve that packed dependency from a simple URL just for you!

For instance, if you would like to use the latest version of the React package, you would only need to use the following URL 👉 https://cratebox.io/react@18.2.0/umd/react.production.min.js

This file will be served from our widespread Cloudflare cache that is spread across 285 cities and 100 countries, so it will be delivered in approximately between 50ms~200ms!

And the most important thing that I would like to mention is that Cratebox.io is 100% open source and it's publicly hosted on GitHub 👉 https://github.com/alexvcasillas/cratebox so you can help improve it, give it a shiny ⭐ and spread the ❤️ or even learn something new 📘

I hope that you find this project interesting and if you get to use it, any feedback would be really appreciated as well as sharing it with your friends and co-workers, or even collaborating with code improvements or some GitHub sponsorships as some monthly costs are around $40 USD related to Vercel and Cloudflare fees 💵

Once again, thank you so much for reading, sharing, and helping ❤️
