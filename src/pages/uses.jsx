            <Tool title="16‚Äù MacBook Pro 2016, 16GB RAM (2016)">
              My first real working tool. Prior to this I didn't know how does a
              MacBook felt and the difference is night and day. Nowadays the
              fans turn on very often, even under not much heavy loads I put it
              so it's starting to feel like it's time for an M2 üòú (pst.. don't
              tell my wife)

              We all know and love Figma. This is where I made designs,
              logotypes, social media stuff and who knows what else we can do

            <Tool title="Reflect">
              Using a daily notes system instead of trying to keep things
              organized by topics has been super powerful for me. And with
              Reflect, it‚Äôs still easy for me to keep all of that stuff
              discoverable by topic even though all of my writing happens in the
              daily note.
            </Tool>
            <Tool title="SavvyCal">
              Great tool for scheduling meetings while protecting my calendar
